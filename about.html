      <h1>About Ubuntu</h1>
      <p>Ubuntu is a website designed for encouragment, affirmation, and everything in between.</p>
      <p>
        Ubuntu is a South African term roughly translated as "human kindness." According to Michael Onyebuchi Eze, the core of Ubuntu can best be summarized as, "a person is a person through other people." When many people, myself included, are going through something, we often times want to be alone, but we also still want encouragement. This website is designed with this in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website provides a series of encouraging and affirming statements, positive news around the world, as well as many other features, such as the ability to just write out your thoughts and vent your emotions and sent it off, as well as to submit your own encouraging statements and stories to be filtered through.
      </p>
      <p>Ubuntu. Because no one should have to go it alone.</p>
